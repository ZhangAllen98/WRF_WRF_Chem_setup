# WRF_WRF_Chem_setup

Commands for installing WRF-Chem on Ubuntu 16.04. Starts with installing netcdf and other dependencies before downloading and compiling WRF-Chem. Its not intended to be run as as a script there are some gigantic file downloads (WRF-Chem emissions file is >2GB).

This is pretty much just the list of steps from WRF compilation tutorials.

Generally speaking if the commands are entered into a tcsh shell carefully a working WRF-Chem install should result!
